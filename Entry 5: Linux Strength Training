Hashing - Super cool usage, stores information in a long string of code that cannot be unhashed. Entering the same information will output the same has hence being able to login on websites without storing text based data.

SHA-256 - Current recommended hash system as MD5 and SHA-1 are considered weak.

Unhashing - programs such as JohntheRipper can be used along with wordlists to attempt to brute force the information. The format can be specified for needed hash algorithms. Can also use hash-identifier or pipe it such as [cat text.txt | hash-identifier].

Base64 - Binary-to-text encoding schemes that represent binary data in an ASCII, some systems rely on a base64 encoding of data for processing while others may not. Use “base64” tool to pipe command cat file.txt | base64 -d [cat file.txt | base64 -d > newtext.txt](new file name).

Encryption - Convert data into an unintelligible code to conceal information, private key to protect data. 
gpg --cipher-algo [encryption type] [encryption method] [file to encrypt]

Decryption - Using the encryption key to make the data legible again.
gpg [file.txt to decrypt]

Cracking Encryption - Brute-force method along with programs such as ‘gpg2john’ which converts the gpg files to hash for johntheripper to compare.
gpg2john [encrypted gpg file] > [filename of the hash you want to create] - creates hash
john wordlist=[location/name of wordlist] --format=gpg [name of hash we just created] - outputs password if found in file.

SQL - Language for storing and manipulating and retrieving data from a database.
Relational databases - Multiple databases that reference each other(Similar to a multi config folder). Each database contains tables of records and each table can consist of multiple columns and rows which store the data in an organized format.
service mysql start/stop - Starts or stops mysql
mysql -u username -p -h 100.10.15.1 = Remote connection
mysql -p password = If set for Auth
mysql -u username -p = Login to mysql
source sql file = Specify database to open
SHOW DATABASES; = Shows all Relational databases
USE database = Chose which database to show.
SHOW TABLE; = Displays selected database tables
DESCRIBE table = view the table structure of individual tables
SELECT * FROM table = Shows ALL data from table
