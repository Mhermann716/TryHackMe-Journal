# Windows Operating System Overview

Windows has been a leading OS since 1985, dominating both home and corporate environments. Its widespread use makes it a primary target for hackers and malware.

**Key Learnings:** Windows Versions

**Key Learnings:** File System

- **File Systems Overview:**
  - **NTFS (New Technology File System):** Used in modern Windows versions.
  - **FAT16/FAT32 and HPFS:** Predecessors of NTFS, still used in USB devices and MicroSD cards.

- **NTFS Features:**
  - **Journaling File System:** Can automatically repair files using log information.
  - **Supports Large Files:** Handles files larger than 4GB.
  - **Permissions:** Allows setting specific permissions on files and folders.
  - **Compression and Encryption:** Supports folder/file compression and encryption (EFS).

- **NTFS Permissions:**
  - Types: Full control, Modify, Read & Execute, List folder contents, Read, Write.
  - How to View: Right-click file/folder > Properties > Security tab.

- **Alternate Data Streams (ADS):**
  - Allows files to contain multiple data streams.
  - Not natively displayed in Windows Explorer.
  - Used by malware to hide data but also for legitimate purposes (e.g., identifying downloaded files).

**Key Learnings:** Users and Profiles

- **User Account Types:**
  - Administrator: Can perform system-level changes like adding/deleting users, modifying system settings.
  - Standard User: Limited to making changes within their own user folders, cannot install programs or modify system settings.

- **Managing User Accounts:**
  - As an Administrator, access "Other users" in System Settings to manage user accounts.
  - Options include adding users, changing account types, and removing accounts.

- **User Profiles:**
  - User profiles are stored in C:\Users and created upon initial login.
  - Each profile contains standard folders like Desktop, Documents, Downloads, Music, and Pictures.

- **Local User and Group Management:**
  - Accessible via Run dialog (lusrmgr.msc) to manage local users and groups.
  - Groups have assigned permissions which users inherit upon group assignment.


**Key Learnings:** User Account Control

- **Administrator Privileges:**
  - Many home users log in as local administrators, allowing them to make system changes.

- **User Account Control (UAC):**
  - Introduced by Microsoft to mitigate risks associated with running with elevated privileges.
  - Not applicable by default to the built-in local administrator account.

- **How UAC Works:**
  - Administrators log in with standard user privileges initially.
  - Prompts users to confirm operations requiring elevated permissions.
  - Reduces malware risk by preventing unauthorized system changes without user consent.

- **Practical Application:**
  - Understand the importance of UAC in protecting systems from malware.
  - Experience UAC prompts and its impact on installing programs as both administrator and standard user accounts.


**Key Learnings:** Windows Settings and Control Panel

- **Settings vs. Control Panel:**
  - **Control Panel:** Traditional interface for system changes, historically used for complex actions like printer setup and program uninstallation.
  - **Settings:** Introduced in Windows 8 and now the primary interface in Windows 10 for system configurations.

- **Accessing Settings and Control Panel:**
  - Both accessible from the Start Menu, though Settings is now more prominent.
  - Control Panel remains essential for accessing more intricate settings not fully transitioned to Settings.

- **Example Usage:**
  - Start with Settings for simpler tasks like changing wallpaper.
  - Transition to Control Panel for more advanced configurations, such as network adapter options.


**Key Learnings:** Task Manager

- **Task Manager Overview:**
  - Provides real-time information on running applications, processes, CPU, and RAM usage.
  - Accessible by right-clicking the taskbar and selecting Task Manager.

- **Features of Task Manager:**
  - **Simple View:** Basic display of running applications.
