Entry 1- SAMPLE
Room Name: Linux Fundamentals 1
Date Completed: 12/20/2023
Notes During the Room:
* Similar to how you have different versions of Windows (7, 8 and 10), there are many different versions/distributions of Linux.


Command
	Description
	echo
	Output any text that we provide
	whoami
	Find out what user we're currently logged in as!
	

Command
	Full Name
	ls
	listing
	cd
	change directory
	cat
	concatenate
	pwd
	print working directory
	



Symbol / Operator
	Description
	&
	This operator allows you to run commands in the background of your terminal.
	&&
	This operator allows you to combine multiple commands together in one line of your terminal.
	>
	This operator is a redirector - meaning that we can take the output from a command (such as using cat to output a file) and direct it elsewhere.
	>>
	This operator does the same function of the > operator but appends the output rather than replacing (meaning nothing is overwritten).
	





Important Takeaways
* Linux is an OS, like Windows. There are many different versions of Linux that serve different purposes. 
* Linux systems rely more heavily on the command line to do tasks, like navigate the file system. 
* Same basic commands while working with files are ls, cd, cat and pwd




Entry 1
Room Name: Linux Fundamentals 1
Date Completed: 04/23/24
Notes During the Room:


Command
	Description
	echo
	Prints input text after echo IE echo “hello World” prints “hello World”
	whoami

Command
	Full Name
	ls
	List’s files.
	cd
	Change into a specific directory IE cd /Home/User/Downloads will put you into the downloads folder of the user in the Terminal
	cat
	Will print the file into the terminal.
	pwd
	Prints directory of current location OR will print the directory of the specified file/folder.
	



Symbol / Operator
	Description
	&
	Tell commands to run in the background.
	&&
	Tells your CLI to use multiple commands, must successfully complete to move to the next command.
	>
	Redirector - meaning that we can take the output from a command and direct it elsewhere. IE cat hello > hey will print hey when you use “cat hello”
	>>
	This operator does the same function of the > operator but adds the output rather than replacing, will print both.
